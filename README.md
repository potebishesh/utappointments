# CSE3311-WebApp
add-node-module branch

### Using a couple of packages here:
cors: allows API calls from front end to backend  
dotenv: place to store configs for our database like passwords, good practice for security reasons  
express: a robust framework for creating web and mobile apps  
mysql: lets us interface with mySQL server and make queries  
nodemon: updates the server so don't have to restart script all the time, it'll watch for us

### How to use nodemon:
Change to be in server directory and use the command in terminal 'nodemon app'.
Done.
